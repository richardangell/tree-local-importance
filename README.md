# TREE-LOCAL-IMPORTANCE

This repo contains investigation into measures of local importance for tree based models. In particular Shapley Values via the treeSHAP algorithm introduced in [Consistent Individualized Feature Attribution for TreeEnsembles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03888.pdf) are compared to the 'prediction decomposition method' introduced in the [Random forest interpretation with scikit-learn](http://blog.datadive.net/random-forest-interpretation-with-scikit-learn/) blog post.
